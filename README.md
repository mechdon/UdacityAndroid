This project is developed as part of Udacity's Developing Android Apps Course.

The app is an Android application which allows the user to parse Weather information (i.e. Current Weather and Weekly Weather forecast) using Open Weather API, based on the user's current or input location. With the app, the user is able to view his/her current location. The user can also choose to present the temperature as metric or imperial units and enable the app to provide notifications.
